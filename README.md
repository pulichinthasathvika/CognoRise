TASK - 1

<d> UNEMPLOYMENT IN INDIA

• Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of
people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force.

• We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19,

• so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project.


TASK - 2
80 CEREALS

• If you like to eat cereal, do yourself a favor and avoid this dataset at all costs.
After seeing these data it will never be the same for me to eat Fruity Pebbles
again.
• Do an explained data analysis

TASK - 4
RED WINE QUALITY

• The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese
"Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult the reference [Cortez et al., 2009].
Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory
(the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types,
wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

• These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes
are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than
excellent or poor ones)
